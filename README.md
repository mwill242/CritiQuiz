Welcome to the AI-Powered Critical Thinking Testing Service called "CritiQuiz".
    Revolutionizing Education with Adaptive Learning Technology.
This repository contains the development materials, documents, and resources for our AI-Powered Testing Service Application, designed to transform how students learn and educators assess.

About the Project.
    Traditional assessments often emphasize rote memorization over critical thinking, leaving students unprepared for real-world problem-solving. Our service reimagines testing by integrating AI-driven adaptive feedback to promote deeper understanding and meaningful learning.

How It Works.
    The application guides students through test questions, offering personalized feedback and multiple attempts to refine their answers. When students answer incorrectly, the AI prompts critical thinking rather than merely providing the correct answer, helping them develop skills essential for the modern world.

This dynamic approach shifts the focus of assessments from recall to reasoning, fostering experiential learning and stronger problem-solving capabilities.
